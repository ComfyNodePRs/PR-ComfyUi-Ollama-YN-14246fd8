# ComfyUi-Ollama-YN
This is just an integrated project. I refer to the ComfyUI-Prompt-MZ project prompt word template setup based on the comfyui-ollama project to make the prompt word generation more consistent with the requirements of stable diffusion

The projects which I referenced are 

https://github.com/stavsap/comfyui-ollama

https://github.com/MinusZoneAI/ComfyUI-Prompt-MZ

I would like to express my special thanks to the authors of these two projects

The default modle is llava model. If you have a better model, you can change the model by changing the model name
